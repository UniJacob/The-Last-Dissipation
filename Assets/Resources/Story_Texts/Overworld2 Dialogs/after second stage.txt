"Research Log #1: Today we've observed an anomaly of sort in botanical samples we've been instructed to investigate.
Some areas of these plants seem to begin dissipating - not decay or die in any conventional sense - simply fade from existence."
"Research Log #14: First confirmed case of this anomaly occuring in animals. A mouse brought to us was exhibiting the same characteristic fading as the plants.
We've come to dub this phenomenon or disease 'Dissipation'. The cause is still unknown."
"Research Log #76: Patient zero has been identified - a 56 years old male researcher from the north. Dissipation symptoms are present in the tips of his limbs.
His cognitive functions remain unimpaired, and interestingly he reports no pain. The implications of a human contracting Dissipation are staggering."
...
So the Dissipation was some sort of disease?
To think there was a disease that caused people to fade from existence... Truly terrifying.
