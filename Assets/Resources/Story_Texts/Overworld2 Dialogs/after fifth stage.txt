Thank you for playing this short demo of The Last Dissipation! I hope you enjoyed it.
Short as it was, the demo still took a considerable amount of time to make. And I hope that, like me, you can see its potential for growth.
I plan to continue to work on the game in the future, but for now this is enough.
Feel free to continue trying to break your own records and getting new highscores in stages.
